<h2>What is a “now page”?</h2>
<p>
Most websites have a link that says “<strong>about</strong>” that tells you the background of this person.
It’s called an “about page”.
</p><p>
Most websites have a link that says “<strong>contact</strong>” that tells you how to contact this person.
It’s called a “contact page”.
</p><p>
Personal websites often have a link that says “<strong>now</strong>” that tells you <strong>what this person is focused on at this point in their life.</strong>
It’s called a “now page”.
</p><p>
See examples by browsing <a href="/">nownownow.com</a>.
</p><p>
The URL is usually “/now”, like it’s usually “/about” and “/contact” in those examples, but the URL could be anything.
</p>

<h2>Don’t social media updates do that?</h2>
<p>
No.
If I wonder how someone is doing these days, it doesn’t help me to see that they went on vacation last week, are upset about something in the news, or even got a new job.
That’s not the big picture.
</p><p>
<strong>
A /now page shares what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.
</strong>
</p>

<h2>Why do I need a now page?</h2>
<p>
If you don’t already have a personal website, with an “about” page that’s about you, then this isn’t for you.
</p><p>
It isn’t for marketing or attention.
It will not benefit you in any business way.
</p><p>
It’s useful <strong>for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site</strong>: because people on your site want to know more about you.
</p><p>
Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities.
By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.
</p><p>
<em>“A few days ago I added my now page and felt an immediate sense of relief from pitch emails that ignored the fact that I said explicitly on my site that my team and I can’t handle unsolicited pitches. Simple idea. Big impact.”</em> — Zach Ware
</p><p>
<em>“Any time I’m in something that kind of feels useful or fun, but isn’t clearly aligned with my bigger goals, I pull up my now page and ask ‘Is it on there? Should I add it?’ Most of the time the answer is no, and I move on. Sometimes it’s yes, and when it is, at least it’s an intentional priority shift.”</em> — <a href="https://practicingdeveloper.com/now/">Gregory Brown</a>

<h2>So what is nownownow.com?</h2>
<p>
After a few people added a /now page to their site — (<a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">see original story</a>) — Greg Albritton suggested we keep <strong>a collection of everyone that has a /now page</strong>.
</p><p>
That’s all this is.
It’s not a business.
It’s not social media.

<h2>How do I get listed on nownownow.com?</h2>
<p>
<strong>If your website already has a /now page on it</strong>, as described and defined above, just <a href="https://sive.rs/contact">email the URL to me</a>.
After you do, I’ll email you back with a link to log in and answer a few questions, which creates your profile here.
</p>

<h2>How do I make a now page?</h2>
<p>
<strong>If you already have a website, but don’t have a /now page</strong>, just add a new page.
(For WordPress and Wix, <a href="https://sive.rs/now2">see my instructions</a>.)
</p><p>
Write something about what you’re doing now, and publish.
Once it’s online, email me the URL.
</p><p>
<strong>If you don’t have a website</strong>, but have been meaning to get one, create a free one at <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">BearBlog.dev</a>.
Before you announce it, I highly recommend getting your own domain name at <a href="https://www.porkbun.com/">porkbun.com</a>.
Point your domain to your Bear blog, and use that.
</p>

<h2>Can we add our business here?</h2>
<p>
No.
Browsing <a href="/">nownownow.com</a> is only interesting because you get a glimpse into people’s lives and how they focus.
</p><p>
If you have a business website that is really just you, then that’s OK.
But other than that, I won’t be adding business sites.
</p>

<h2>You know what this needs? …</h2>
<p>
Please tell me.
I’m here as a public servant, taking requests.
</p><p>
Or just make something first, and let me know.
No need to ask my permission.
</p>

<h2>Who is behind this?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a>.
That’s me.
</p><p>
I’m just doing this because people asked me to.
<a href="https://sive.rs/contact">Email me</a> with any questions or suggestions.
