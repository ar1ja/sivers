IMPORTANT: these files are not used here, and don't need to exist.
They are just a dump of the PostgreSQL table called "templates".
They are only used inside PostgreSQL itself, by the Mustache
template parser functions starting in ../omni/template.sql

But for ease of editing, they are here for syncing.

How to sync?

scripts/template-sync.rb
